# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Challenge 13: React Portfolio

For this challenge, you will utilize what you have learned in `Module 13: React` to develop the initial scaffolding of your portfolio sites.

Now that you've worked with React and have multiple projects to share, it's time to develop the initial scaffolding for your first portfolio site as well as create and/or update other materials so that you can showcase your skills to potential employers. Creating a portfolio using React will help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios do not use some of the latest technologies.

## Instructions

* Students must fullfil the requirements listed in the following sections:

### Design

Remember, "good" design is subjective. Your site should look "polished" and "professional". Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

* Mobile-first design

* Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.

* Make sure the font size is large enough to read and that the colors don't cause eye strain.

    * [ ] Be sure to store your project data in a JSON file and import it into your project
* [ ] Project:
  * [ ] Must be a reusable component that ingests JSON data as a props and renders a single instance for each project.
  * [ ] Must utilize router props to properly render the right project based on user selection
